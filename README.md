# ImageClassificationBrain

This project demonstrates image classification using a pretrained ResNet50 model from PyTorch. It loads an input image, applies the necessary transformations, and performs inference to output the top 5 predicted ImageNet classes along with their probabilities. The project highlights working with deep learning models, image preprocessing, tensor operations, and PyTorch's model evaluation workflow.
